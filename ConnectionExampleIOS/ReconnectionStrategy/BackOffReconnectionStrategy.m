/**
 
    Concept behind this reconnection strategy
 
    When this strategy is called for the first time in its session, the reconnection attempt is immediate
    If the first attempt fails, it waits for 1.0 seconds before trying again. Each subsequent failed attempt will increase the delay by another 1.0 seconds
    If this reconnection strategy is called after an interval greater than the last reconnection attempt delay, it considers that the last attempt was a successful one, and reset the attempt counter.
    For each reconnection attempt, the attempt timestamp is registered in the reconnection strategy
